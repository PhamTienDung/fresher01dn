/**
 * should contains method getArea() to calculate the area of it (e.g area of a
 * circle is pi* r2). Each three-dimensional shape should contain getArea() and
 * getVolume() methods
 * to calculate the surface area and volume respectively.
 * Create a program that uses an array of Shape references to objects of each
 * concrete class in the hierarchy. The program should print the object to which
 * each array element refers.
 * Also in the loop that processes all the shapes in the array, determine
 * whether each shape is a two-dimensional shape or three-dimensional shape. If
 * a shape
 * is two-dimensional one, display its area. If a shape is three -dimensional
 * one, display its area and volume.
